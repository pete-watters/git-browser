# ember-cli-mocha

Mocha / Chai testing for your Ember CLI apps.

## Installation

Install ember-cli-mocha:

```sh
ember install ember-cli-mocha
```

## Usage

Tests rely on [ember-mocha](https://github.com/switchfly/ember-mocha) modules
and helpers. Please refer to that project to understand detailed usage.

### Blueprints

Previous releases of this addon contained the blueprints necessary to generate
Mocha tests for your apps and addons. These blueprints have since been moved
into [ember.js](https://github.com/emberjs/ember.js/tree/master/blueprints),
[ember-data](https://github.com/emberjs/data/tree/master/blueprints) and
[ember-cli-legacy-blueprints](https://github.com/ember-cli/ember-cli-legacy-blueprints/tree/master/blueprints).

Recent releases of Ember CLI contain `ember-cli-legacy-blueprints` by default.
If you are using an older release then please add the
`ember-cli-legacy-blueprints` dependency manually to your project.
