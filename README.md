# git-browser

This is a simple Ember app that connects to the GitHub API and allows you to search for organisations. You can view organisations and filter their repo based on criteria. 

## Development notes
* this app uses the git-flow branching strategy (because it's awesome!) 
* sessionAuthentication: This is handled using ember-simple-auth
* ember-data-github: This add on is used as a base from which serializers, adapters and models are extended
* styling: a combination of Neat /Bourbon / Bitters / Refills are used to improve the asthetics of the app

## Installation - to run

* `git clone <repository-url>` this repository
* `cd git-browser`
* `npm install`
* `bower install`

## Running / Development

* `ember serve`
* Visit your app at [http://localhost:4200](http://localhost:4200).


### Testing

### Overview
 I attempted to use ember-mocha at first but I don't think it's a polished tool just yet so I went back to qUnit after having some difficulty. 
 I focused on acceptance tests as I believe that's the most important tests for front end. With more time I would extend integration and unit testing further. 
 For UI testing I believe you really can't beat Selenium which uses actual browsers.
 
### GIT personal access token
* The GitHub access token is required by the tests. There is a helper in 'tests/helpers/custom/api-key.js' you can specify it in. 
* I have set this to 'INSERT-YOUR-KEY' as if I commit mine it will become invalid. 
* You need to update this for the tests to pass

## To run tests
* `ember serve`
* Visit your test results at [http://localhost:4200/tests](http://localhost:4200/tests).


### Building

* `ember build` (development)
* `ember build --environment production` (production)

### Deploying

If you do a production build you can deploy the contents of the dist/ folder to a webserver of your choosing. 

## Optional installation for further development

* [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (with NPM)
* [Bower](https://bower.io/)
* [Ember CLI](https://ember-cli.com/)
* [PhantomJS](http://phantomjs.org/)
* [SASS](http://sass-lang.com/)
* [git-flow](https://github.com/nvie/gitflow)

### Install Bitters:
* [Bitters] (https://www.npmjs.com/package/bourbon-bitters) 
Need to install 1.2.0 to work with stable bourbon
  * gem install bitters -v 1.2.0

Install Bourbon. Then cd into your Sass directory and run:
  * bitters install

A base directory will be generated which contains all of the Bitters files. Import Bitters after Bourbon in your application.css.scss:
  * @import "bourbon";
  * @import "base/base";
